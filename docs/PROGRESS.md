## 2026-10-21 — D11 owner decision: generated starter catalogue (pending owner review; Checkpoint 2 still awaiting approval)

- **Owner decision:** no existing catalogue; the owner authorized the agent to generate a proposed starter catalogue from scratch. D11 is now: **Owner authorized catalogue generation; generated catalogue pending owner review and approval.** The catalogue itself is **not approved**.
- **Done:**
  - Created `catalogue/horekbazar/`, a draft review/import package kept outside `data/` and outside core logic, never read at runtime and excluded from the sellable template.
  - Contents: 39 categories (9 top-level, 30 leaf); 144 products and 235 variants with original Bangla/English names, descriptions, attributes, SKUs (`HB-<CAT>-<NNN>-<VAR>`) and SEO; JSON Schema 2020-12; price research (`PRICE-RESEARCH.md`, `prices.csv`); image manifest plus acquisition checklist; sources; review checklist; gated import instructions; and a zero-dependency validator and report tool.
  - Added `docs/domain-rules.md` §16 (catalogue workflow).
  - Updated `DESIGN.md`, `docs/LICENSING.md`, `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
- **Research:**
  - Market mix: DHL/ECDB, BSS reporting BBS 2024-25, DCIF (figures conflict with BSS, unresolved), ShopRank.
  - Prices: official TCB Dhaka retail list of 26 Feb 2026 (XLSX downloaded and read); the TCB daily page returned HTTP 502 on 2026-10-21; October 2026 news corroborates the rice ranges.
  - BSTI mandatory-certification lists: two official PDFs plus secondary reports of later additions.
- **Draft state (verified by the validator):**
  - Every record is `draft` / `pending_owner_review`.
  - Stock is 0, `unverified` and `unavailable`.
  - `brand: null`, and all 144 products have images `missing`.
  - Prices: 39 are reference-derived from TCB; 196 are unsourced estimates; all require owner review; no compare-at prices.
  - BSTI flags: 33 likely, 43 unknown, 68 not found. All flags are **[L]**.
- **Validation run:**
  - `node catalogue/horekbazar/tools/catalogue.mjs validate`: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
  - Ajv 8 (draft 2020-12, strict, formats; run outside the repo, no dependency added): all 4 files valid.
  - Negative test on a mutated copy: both validators rejected it. The validator reported 10 errors: stock above 0, an added `rating` field, a pre-approved record, an invented compare-at price, "100% pure organic" copy, a duplicate SKU, an SKU/id mismatch and `importAllowed: true`.
- **Not done (not authorized):** no database connection, no import, no application code, no images sourced.
- **Open:** owner review of taxonomy, products, brands and every price; image acquisition; BSTI, BTRC, courier and polythene checks **[L]**; D12 location dataset (unchanged, open); D5 deferred.
- **Next:** owner reviews the catalogue package and approves (or redirects) Checkpoint 2. Checkpoint 3 does not start until Checkpoint 2 is explicitly approved.

## 2026-10-21 — Checkpoint 2 amendments (waiting for final Checkpoint 2 approval)

- **Done:** applied owner decisions to `DESIGN.md` and `docs/domain-rules.md`; added §12 replica-set requirement, §13 outbox scheduler (`JOBS_TRIGGER`: `worker` / `http` / `vercel-cron` on Pro only), §14 Zod → MongoDB validator generation with CI checks, §15 legal basis register (all legal points marked **[L]**, need local legal review); rewrote §5 pricing (integer minor units, rounding, coupon eligibility/minimums, free-delivery coupons, largest-remainder allocation, partial-cancellation fairness rule); defined the 100-on-10 stock concurrency proof; researched BD location datasets (§6.1); updated `docs/LICENSING.md` with data attribution and catalogue-rights notes.
- **Verified:** `zod@4.6.7` ships `z.toJSONSchema`; `better-auth@1.7.12` exports `./plugins/two-factor`; MongoDB docs: transactions need a replica set; Atlas Free clusters: 3-node replication, 100 ops/s, 500 connections, backups available (corrected an earlier wrong claim); Vercel Hobby cron: once per day, per-hour (±59 min) precision; COD-AB Bangladesh: CC BY-IGO 3.0, 507 upazila features. Removed an unverified "cron not retried" claim; aligned `README.md` and `DESIGN.md` `data/` wording with D11.
- **Decided (owner, approved in principle):** D7 staff 2FA, D8 promotions, D9 rewards as non-cash loyalty discount (legal review before launch), D10 localisation, D13 phone + admin confirmation, D14 no SMS, D15 no online payments, D16 exclusions; D5 deferred.
- **Open:** D11 real catalogue (owner supplies/approves; empty dev DB meanwhile), D12 location dataset selection (licence, attribution, version, 495 vs 507 upazila count to reconcile).
- **Next:** owner approves Checkpoint 2 → Checkpoint 3 (design research and direction). No application code until Checkpoint 4 is approved.

## 2026-10-21 — Process rule added

- **Done:** added `AGENTS.md` (owner working rules, repo boundaries, hard rules) and this log.
- **Decided (owner):** push after every phase and change; summary per phase here; all changed `.md` files delivered as one copyable block.
- **Next:** owner answers Checkpoint 2.

## 2026-10-21 — Checkpoint 2: Product contract (PROPOSED, waiting for approval)

- **Done:** product contract, type research (Chaldal, Rokomari, Shajgoj Shop, Pickaboo, Medusa starter), Scope table (33 storefront routes, 27 admin surfaces, 12 journeys, states, edges, skeletons) in `DESIGN.md`; detailed rules in `docs/domain-rules.md`; licence plan in `docs/LICENSING.md`. Scope table parses with the skill's `completeness.mjs` (failures only for unbuilt routes and the Step 2 research record).
- **Decided (owner):** no mock-data fallback, real dev database, `data/` is seed input only; basic commercial licence, provisional. D1 Better Auth, D3 push library chosen later, D4 polling chat + optional Ably accepted with Checkpoint 1.
- **Open:** D5 Vercel scope/tier, D7 staff 2FA, D8 promotion stacking, D9 rewards legal shape, D10 URL strategy, D11 real catalogue, D12 BD location dataset, D13 customer verification, D14 SMS, D15 online payments, D16 exclusions.
- **Next:** after approval → Checkpoint 3 (design research, 2–3 directions, synthesis, type, colour, `DESIGN.md` + `SCHEMA.md`).

## 2026-10-21 — Setup and Checkpoint 1: Stack (approved with amendments)

- **Done:** `gh` authenticated as `dev-asfakul`; created private `dev-asfakul/horekbazar`; inspected `asfakulsiam/asfakulsiam-motomation-design` (public, untouched); installed skill v3.0.2 (identical to upstream); audited Node 20.20.2 / npm 10.8.2; Vercel CLI authenticates but default scope `dev-choice` rejects the token.
- **Decided:** Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, strict TS, Tailwind 4, Radix/shadcn, Zod, MongoDB official driver, Better Auth, Upstash Redis, MongoDB outbox + cron, Cloudinary, Resend, Gemini (server-only), next-intl; host-portable.
- **Next:** Checkpoint 2.
