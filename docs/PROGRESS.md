# Progress log

Newest first. Each entry: date, phase, done, decided, open, next.

## 2026-10-21 — Process rule added

- **Done:** added `AGENTS.md` (owner working rules, repo boundaries, hard rules) and this log.
- **Decided (owner):** push after every phase and change; summary per phase here; all changed `.md` files delivered as one copyable block.
- **Next:** owner answers Checkpoint 2.

## 2026-10-21 — Checkpoint 2: Product contract (PROPOSED, waiting for approval)

- **Done:** product contract, type research (Chaldal, Rokomari, Shajgoj Shop, Pickaboo, Medusa starter), Scope table (33 storefront routes, 27 admin surfaces, 12 journeys, states, edges, skeletons) in `DESIGN.md`; detailed rules in `docs/domain-rules.md`; licence plan in `docs/LICENSING.md`. Scope table parses with the skill's `completeness.mjs` (failures only for unbuilt routes and the Step 2 research record).
- **Decided (owner):** no mock-data fallback, real dev database, `data/` is seed input only; basic commercial licence, provisional. D1 Better Auth, D3 push library chosen later, D4 polling chat + optional Ably accepted with Checkpoint 1.
- **Open:** D5 Vercel scope/tier, D7 staff 2FA, D8 promotion stacking, D9 rewards legal shape, D10 URL strategy, D11 real catalogue, D12 BD location dataset, D13 customer verification, D14 SMS, D15 online payments, D16 exclusions.
- **Next:** after approval → Checkpoint 3 (design research, 2–3 directions, synthesis, type, colour, `DESIGN.md` + `SCHEMA.md`).

## 2026-10-21 — Setup and Checkpoint 1: Stack (approved with amendments)

- **Done:** `gh` authenticated as `dev-asfakul`; created private `dev-asfakul/horekbazar`; inspected `asfakulsiam/asfakulsiam-motomation-design` (public, untouched); installed skill v3.0.2 (identical to upstream); audited Node 20.20.2 / npm 10.8.2; Vercel CLI authenticates but default scope `dev-choice` rejects the token.
- **Decided:** Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, strict TS, Tailwind 4, Radix/shadcn, Zod, MongoDB official driver, Better Auth, Upstash Redis, MongoDB outbox + cron, Cloudinary, Resend, Gemini (server-only), next-intl; host-portable.
- **Next:** Checkpoint 2.
